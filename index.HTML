<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"
target="_blank" title="캐나다"/>  Canada<a/></strong> is a country in
the northern part of North America.<br>
<img src="Flag_of_Canada.jpg" width="700"> <br>
Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean,<br>
covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles),<br>
making it the world's second-largest country by total area.<br>
Canada's southern border with the United States,<br>
stretching some 8,891 kilometres is the world's longest bi-national land border.<br>
Its capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.<br>
As a whole, Canada is sparsely populated,<br>
the majority of its land area being dominated by forest and tundra.<br>
Consequently, its population is highly urbanized,<br>
with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities,<br>
with 70% of citizens residing within 100 kilometres (62 mi) of the southern border.<br>
Canada's climate varies widely across its vast area,<br>
ranging from arctic weather in the north,<br>
to hot summers in the southern regions,<br>
with four distinct seasons.<br>
